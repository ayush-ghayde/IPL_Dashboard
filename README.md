### Project Title 
ðŸ“Š IPL Player Performance Analysis Dashboard  
A comprehensive Python-based analytical dashboard for visualizing and understanding Indian Premier League (IPL) player performance, team statistics, and key metrics.

### Short Description / Purpose
This project provides insightful visualizations and analysis of IPL player performance, including batting, bowling, and fielding statistics across teams. It aims to help cricket analysts, fans, and team strategists understand player contributions, team dynamics, and performance trends to inform strategic decisions and enhance fandom engagement.

### Tech Stack
The project uses the following key technologies:  
â€¢ Excel :- for cleaning the dataset

### Data Source
The data is sourced from an Excel file named `IPL Project.xlsx`, containing detailed IPL player statistics. Key metrics include matches played, runs scored, batting average, strike rate, wickets taken, bowling average, economy rate, catches, run-outs, stumps, and player attributes like nationality, team, and player type (batter, bowler, keeper, allrounder).

### Features / Highlights
- **Player Performance Analysis**: Visualize individual player stats such as runs, wickets, batting average, strike rate, and bowling economy to identify top performers.  
- **Team Insights**: Aggregate and compare team-level statistics, including total runs, matches played, and player type distribution (e.g., batters, bowlers, keepers, allrounders).  
- **Nationality Breakdown**: Analyze the contribution of Indian vs. Overseas players across teams, highlighting capped and uncapped players.  
- **Custom Visualizations**: Generate charts (e.g., bar plots for team runs, scatter plots for batting vs. bowling performance) to uncover trends and patterns.  
- **Interactive Exploration**: Leverage Jupyter Notebook for dynamic data exploration, enabling users to filter and visualize specific metrics like strike rate or wickets by team or player type.  
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify key players for strategic team-building (e.g., top run-scorers like Virat Kohli or wicket-takers like Yuzvendra Chahal) and evaluate team balance based on player roles.
